# JMF
A general joint matrix factorization framework for data integration
- JMF (Joint Matrix Factorization) is a MATLAB package to integrate multi-view data as well as prior relationship knowledge 
within or between multi-view data for pattern recognition and data mining. 
- Four update rules are adopted for solving JMF. 
- Two adapted prediction JMF models based on JMF are provided.
Check out our paper for a more complete description of the methods and analyses (L. Zhang and S. Zhang, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 2019[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8762181]).
